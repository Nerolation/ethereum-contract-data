# ethereum-contract-data
For researchers the search for high-quality data can quickly become exhausting and might cost quite some time. 
Blockchain data often requires users to run a node, understand fundamental priciples of the underlying blockchain or complex libraries and programming languages.

To tackle this issue and assist scientists digging deeper into Ethereum and its contract landscape I publicly host data on the largest Ethereum-based contracts.
This involves Event logs that are broadcasted by the respective contracts to document actions happened on the blockchain.

###### Note: Currently data mainly involes EIP-20 compatible Transfer Events and supply-regulating Events such as Mint and Burn

Available contracts:

**Stablecoins**
* Tether (USDT)
* USD Coin (USDC)
* TrueUSD (TUSD)
* Dai Stablecoin (DAI)
* Paxos Standard (PAX)
* Binance USD (BUSD)
* HUSD (HUSD)
</br>

**Wrapped Tokens**
* Wrapped Ether
* Wrapped Bitcoin
* Wrapped Filecoin
</br>

**Defi Tokens**
* Uniswap Token (UNI)
* Maker Token (MKR)
* Compound Token (COMP)
* Chainlink (LINK)
* Synthetix (SNX)
